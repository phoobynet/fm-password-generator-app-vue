- [check-password-strength](https://www.npmjs.com/package/check-password-strength)

### What I learned

- Think in terms of boxes, then components.
- Get CSS properties done upfront, and give them meaningful names.
- Work on components first
  - Break down the design into smaller components
    - Do the HTML FIRST
    - Style for mobile
    - Keep in mind active and hover states
    - Then do each tablet, desktop, etc
    - DON'T move on until each **COMPONENTS** layout looks correct on each device
- Only consider the final page layout until all components layouts match the design.
- Take regular breaks, and don't get frustrated.
